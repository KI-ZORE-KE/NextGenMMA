Website Design Philosophy

- User-Centric
- Maintainable
- Scalable
- Responsive

The semantic HTML layout was structured with accessibility and clarity in mind. Sections are marked with proper <section>, <header>, <footer>, 
and <nav> elements to enhance readability, improve SEO, and ensure compatibility with screen readers. 

The design follows a sleek, dark-themed aesthetic suited for combat sports branding.

Key styling choices:

- Dark Background with Accent Highlights:
  * A gradient dark theme is used to reflect the high-energy, gritty nature of MMA.
  * Orange highlights (#ff6b35) establish brand identity and guide user focus (e.g., section headers, fighter names, borders).

- Glassmorphism & Soft Neomorphism:
  * box-shadow, linear-gradient, and border-radius are used to create modern, depth-rich fighter cards.
  * Fighter cards and fight listings subtly elevate on hover, reinforcing interactivity.

- Responsive Design:
  * Components like fighters-grid switch from multi-column to single-column on smaller viewports, improving readability.

- Sticky Header:
  *The header remains in view on scroll (position: sticky) for constant access to navigation.

Two arrays (sampleFighters[], sampleFights[]) were created to store fighter and event data.

Accessibility & Performance
- Uses system-default font stacks ('Arial', sans-serif) for fast loading.
- High contrast color scheme supports readability.
